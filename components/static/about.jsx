        <p>We’ll make politics transparent for the citizens.</p>

        <p>
          We want to change the perspective of politics and make politics and
          minister work transparent and accessible every time for citizens.
          Instead of the minister's word, citizens will believe in data.
        </p>

        <p>
          And want to break the hidden wall between the common man and minister.
          Ministers should be accessible all the time.
        </p>

        <p>
          All of this makes India a more cohesive, participative and involved
          democracy.
